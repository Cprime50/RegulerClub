# REGULER CLUB

This repository is dedicated to the Reguler Club application, currently a work in progress. If you're interested in learning about how this application is built, check out this [written tutorial](https://www.charlesdpj.com/categories/reguler-club/) where I will be documenting the entire process from start to finish.

I also plan to create video tutorials in the future and upload them to YouTube.

The diagram above may not be the best, but it gives an idea of what I will be building.
